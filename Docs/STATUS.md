# STATUS.md

Working notes for continuing the project (updated 2026-10-14). Read CLAUDE.md and GAME_DESIGN.md first.

## Where we are
Milestones 1 to 3 are done and playable (menu, planet map with difficulties and completion marks, level 1, result screen with stars,
base upgrade screen, saved progress). Parts of milestone 4 (tower damage, repair, wreck/scrap) and the in-level tower menu exist.
The look uses CC0 Kenney assets (see CREDITS.md). It is placeholder quality on purpose.

## Open issue being chased
Player reports "cannot place turrets" (twice). Placement code was fixed once (tower menu swallowed mouse clicks) and works in simulated
tests, but the report came back. Diagnostics now log every confirm to the console as `[Placement] ...` (mode, cell, canBuild, money,
pointerOverUi). Next step: ask the player to try placing once, then read `Logs/Editor.log` for those lines and fix what they show.
The HUD blocking check now only counts real buttons under the pointer.

## How the visuals can change later
- Models and tints are data: `VisualTheme` (terrain, road, base, scenery, colours per level), `TowerDefinition.Model`, `EnemyDefinition.Model`.
- Interface look is data: `UiSkin` (sprites, fonts). Screens are built in code from `UiKit`.
- Logic never references visuals (view components only), so swapping models or restyling needs no gameplay changes.

## Known gaps and ideas
- Road/terrain uses plain slabs; richer per-level themes, effects (lasers, explosions, damage numbers) and audio come in milestone 10.
- Hard and Psycho difficulty are untested for balance.
- Wrecks/scrap economy, blockades and hero, drones, path objects, combining are later milestones.
- Root `GAME_DESIGN.md` is a duplicate of `Docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` (delete was blocked; remove by hand).
- Remote repo: not set up yet. Push only when the user provides a private repo URL.

## Handy facts
- Unity CLI path and commands: see `Docs/COMMANDS.md`.
- Regenerate data and scenes: menu `Tools/Generate/Scenes and Starter Data`. It is idempotent and overwrites generated assets.
- Play Mode only advances when the Editor window is focused; for automated checks step frames with `EditorApplication.Step()`.

## Milestone 5 (blockades and hero) - first slice

- **Blockades** are `TowerDefinition`s with `BlocksGroundEnemies` placed by `LevelDefinition.Blockades` (cell + definition).
  They reuse Tower: levels, HP bonus per level (`TowerLevel.HealthBonus`), guns from level 2, repair, and "rebuild" when wrecked
  (level 0 cost). Ground enemies stop within 0.85 of a living blockade and hit it (`EnemyDefinition.BlockadeDamage`).
- **Hero** (`Game.Hero.Commander`, `HeroDefinition`): posts = every blockade + the base. Move with the HUD panel (bottom left),
  keys H / F / G (X, LT, RT on a gamepad), or the third icon of a blockade menu ("Send hero"). Guards a blockade (takes
  `GuardShare` of the hits), goes down when its health runs out and returns after `ReviveSeconds`.
- Not done yet: permanent hero upgrades in the upgrade screen, hero visuals beyond placeholders, balance pass for hard/psycho.

## Custom (AI) models

- Put a single-mesh `.glb` in `Assets/_Project/Art/Models/Custom/`, add a recipe for it in `ModelRecipe.For` (parts are
  chosen by where a triangle sits in the model's bounding box), run `Tools/Generate/Build Custom Models` (also part of the
  starter-data generator). It writes mesh, materials and prefab to `Custom/Built/`.
- `GlbMeshReader` only reads positions and triangles. Models with textures or several materials need a real glTF
  importer (glTFast package), which is not installed.
- A tower using such a model sets `KeepModelColours` so the tower tint and glow are not applied (pulse rifle does).

## Milestones 6 to 10 - first versions (built unattended on 2026-10-14, please review)

Choices made without asking, because the design doc leaves them open. All are data or small code, easy to change:

- **Drones:** work on their own (no manual steering). Repair drones heal the most damaged tower or blockade for free,
  collector drones pick up loot that defeated enemies drop (a bonus of half the reward, only while collectors fly).
  Bought between levels with power currency, as upgrade levels in the "Drones" group (one level = one more drone).
  Flying enemies can shoot them down; lost drones stay lost for that level.
- **Path objects** (`PathObjectDefinition`, kinds Mine / SlowField / Roller): consumed on use or after a lifetime, not
  upgradeable. Each level sells a subset (see `LevelDefinition.PathObjects`). Placed like towers (select in the bar, click a
  cell, click again). Road objects need a free road cell; "beside" objects a free build cell.
- **Combining:** `CombineRecipe` (two kinds + result + price). Select a tower next to its partner and a fourth icon
  "Combine" appears. Both towers become one hybrid (value of both is kept for selling). Only level 5 lists recipes, as in
  the design table. Hybrids: Artillery (Cannon+Rocket), Storm Rifle (Pulse+Tesla), Cryo Beam (Laser+Cryo).
- **Towers:** all eight standard towers exist (Laser and Tesla are plain fast/splash shooters for now, Cryo slows, Support
  boosts range and fire rate nearby). Railgun and Support are not rewarded in world 1 (as designed), only reachable with
  the unlock-all test option.
- **Levels 2 to 5** are generated data (`ProjectGenerator.World.cs`): own palette, road layout, blockades, bosses on 2/4/5,
  second entrance on 2 and 5, a new weapon as reward each. Enemy health scales per level (`EnemyHealthMultiplier`).
- **In-level kill money no longer scales with difficulty** (it made hard levels easier); research and power rewards still do.
- **Audio** is generated at runtime (`ProceduralSfx`, played by `SfxPlayer`): shots, kills, explosions, base hits.
- **Balance probe:** `BalanceProbeTests` plays all levels and difficulties with a greedy bot and logs the outcome.
  With the current numbers the bot wins Easy on every level and loses Psycho on all but the first. Real players have
  upgrades, hero and drones, so expect it to be easier for them. Tune `CountScale`/`HealthScale` per level in the generator.
- **Screenshots without the editor:** `ScreenshotTests` writes `Logs/screenshot_level5.png`.

Still open / known gaps: hero and drone models are placeholders, no per-tower second upgrade path from level 3 (design
mentions two paths), boss abilities, endless mode, real audio, menu navigation by gamepad has not been tried on hardware.

## Look, maps and drones (2026-10-14, evening)

- **Maps:** 20x12 (Landing), 26x14 (Forest), 22x16 (Lava), 28x16 (Ruins), 24x14 (Nest). Roads, blockades, flight routes and
  terrain are authored in `ProjectGenerator.World.cs`; rock formations and mining nodes are placed from a fixed seed
  (`ProjectGenerator.Terrain.cs`). A side road is merged into the main road after the junction (`MergeIntoMain`) and the
  validator rejects any road that does not end at the base.
- **Landscape:** `TerrainField` (heights and masks) -> `TerrainPainter` (ground texture, cobbled road) ->
  `TerrainSurfaceBuilder`, `TerrainLiquidBuilder`, `PropScatterBuilder`, `AmbientParticlesBuilder`. The generator bakes the ground
  texture to `Art/Terrain/*.png` (`BakeTerrain`); without it the level paints at load time. Terrain is data on the level
  (`TerrainPatch`: Raised, Water, Lava, Quicksand; liquids are not buildable, raised ground lifts towers).
- **Models:** all procedural (`PropMeshBuilder` and the `*ModelFactory` classes). Towers, enemies and path objects choose
  their model by an enum on their definition (`TowerShape`, `EnemyShape`, `PathObjectLook`). The Pulse Rifle keeps the
  imported machine gun and gets add-ons per level (`TowerShape.PulseRifle`).
- **Animation:** enemies walk with distance-synced legs, rear/strike/flinch on attack and hit; the commander winds up and cuts
  with a lunge and a blade trail. Tower barrels recoil.
- **Camera:** WASD / arrows / right stick pan, wheel / `-` `+` / stick clicks zoom (`CameraPanZoom`, `FixedCameraRig.SetView`).
  The keyboard no longer moves the build cursor (the mouse and the left stick do).
- **Drones:** bought in the level with energy (`EnergyPool`, `LevelDefinition.EnergyMax/EnergyPerSecond`, starts at 0). Collectors
  take loot first, otherwise mine one of the level's `MineCells` and carry the yield home. Permanent upgrades only add free
  starting drones.
- **Known gaps:** death animation, hero leg animation, boss abilities, endless mode, real audio, balance on the bigger maps
  (see the probe results below if present), gamepad testing on hardware.
- **Test tooling:** the Unity CLI test runner returns 0 tests for PlayMode; run PlayMode with Unity closed (see COMMANDS.md).

## Alive battlefield pass (2026-10-28)

Done after the first real play session ("playable, but static lines, weak sound, no death animation, flat lava"):

- **Waves:** every enemy gets its own lane on the road (`PathOffset` mitres the corners; room depends on body size, so
  bosses stay centred), its own pace (`Enemy.SpeedMultiplier`, +/-12%) and flyers their own height. Spawn moments drift
  by `WaveDefinition.SpawnJitter` (share of the interval, default 0.45) through a `System.Random` handed to
  `WaveScheduler`; without one the scheduler is exact, which the tests rely on. Walkers weave with their stride, flyers
  drift and roll, every creature has its own gait rate.
- **Animation and effects:** enemies rise out of the gate (`EnemyView` spawn curve) and fall apart on death
  (`EnemyDeathEffect`, pooled by `EnemyDeathEffectPool`: the body parts fly, tumble, land and shrink while ichor in the
  creature's colour splashes). Towers flash at the muzzle on every shot. `ImpactFlash` adds sparks, and for splash hits
  a shock ring and smoke. `FixedCameraRig.Shake` plus `CameraShaker` kick the camera on explosions, base hits, boss
  deaths and the hero's shockwave.
- **Sound:** `ProceduralSfx` is a small synth (tones with sweeps, filtered noise, crackle, echo, soft clip) with cached
  clips: pulse, heavy, rocket and cryo shots (picked from `ShotInfo` on `ProjectilePool.Shot`), small and big explosions,
  enemy and boss deaths, boss roar, base alarm, wave horn, build, upgrade, repair, sell, drone, hero strike and shockwave,
  structure hits, and a looping ambience per theme (`VisualTheme.Ambience`, `AmbienceKind`: Wind, Forest, Lava, Ruins,
  Hive). New context events carry the moments: `EnemySpawned`, `EnemyKilled`, `StructureHit`, `WaveStarted`,
  `TowerBuilt/Upgraded/Repaired/Sold`, `PathObjectPlaced`. `EnemyDefinition.IsBoss` marks the three bosses.
- **Liquids:** subdivided sheets with rolling waves (`LiquidFlow.SetWaves`), a second additive layer drifting at another
  pace (heat blotches, water sparkle threads, sand streaks), lava emission that breathes, flickering point lights over
  lava clusters (`LightFlicker`, at most ten), and motes from the liquid cells themselves (embers and sparks, dust,
  sparkles and mist) scaled by `IPlatformSettings.ParticleScale`. The lava ball sheds embers and carries a light.
- **Terrain details:** prop glow is brighter and breathes (`EmissionPulse` on the shared glow materials), plants sway
  (`WindSway`), rocks sit in a dark skirt with glowing moss on some, crystals have shards and a pool of light; the
  biggest glowing formations on blocked cells get a flickering light (at most twelve) and crystals shed sparks. Raised
  ground shows strata, a pale lip and a glowing seam on its cliffs (`TerrainPainter.ShadeCliff`, baked by the
  generator) and loose rubble along its edges (`PropScatterBuilder.PlaceRubble`).
- **Settings:** GPU Resident Drawer disabled on `PC_RPAsset` (see COMMANDS.md for why). The two deprecation warnings
  in `ScreenshotTests` and `UiKit` are fixed, so the project compiles with zero warnings.
- **Not verified on hardware:** gamepad, and the PlayMode suite was not run in this session (needs Unity closed); the
  levels were played through the CLI with probe towers and showed no errors.

## Look pass two (2026-10-28, later)

Asked for after the first pass: gates, hero, shores, flora and the base.

- **Shores and craters:** liquid masks get five blur passes; water and sand slope down like a beach
  (`TerrainField` basin profile), lava sits in a crater with a thrown-up rim. `TerrainPainter` paints a pale beach,
  a wet line and foam at the waterline, and an ash-grey crater rim with hot cracks. Baked by the generator.
- **Flora and crystals v2:** `PropMeshBuilder` takes a submesh count and has `AddBlade` (double-sided ribbons).
  `PropFactory` uses six slots (rock, glow, second glow, dark, leaf, bright core): hexagonal prisms with bright tips
  and shards, broad curling leaves, ribbed mushroom caps with a lit rim, trees on roots with layered canopies and
  hanging fruit, rocks in a dark skirt. Every glowing prop stands in a pool of light (`GlowDecal.PlacePool`).
- **Base:** `StructureModelFactory.BaseReactor` is an octagonal landing platform with a lit rim, a command dome
  ringed with windows, a caged reactor core, antenna mast, corner pylons and habitat tanks; the ring is a holo ring
  plus the radar sweep. A flickering light and a glow pool sit under it, and the glow material breathes.
- **Gates:** blockades are drawn by `GateView` (two pylons, a crossbeam, an energy field: a vertical sheet plus a
  glowing strip on the road). The field dims with damage and stutters under half health. A wreck bursts the field,
  tilts the pylons, drops the beam, blackens everything and keeps smoking and sparking until rebuilt. The gun head
  sits on the beam. The alien spawn points are hive mouths (`EnemyGate`, creature palette) with a light and spores.
- **Hero:** separate legs, head and arm (`HeroModelFactory`): walks on its legs, scans with its head while waiting,
  breathes, burns its thrusters while moving, and carries a tall beacon with a spinning emblem so it stays visible
  behind towers on raised ground.
- **Play-test scripts** moved to `Tools/PlayTest/` because Unity wipes `Temp/`.

## Look pass three (2026-10-28, late)

Feedback on pass two: no visible gate explosion, flat flora, hero always in a fighting pose, hero inside the base,
base not a building, lava without rock edges, slow camera.

- **Gate explosion:** `Tower.Wrecked` fires once per wreck; `PlacementController` turns it into
  `LevelContext.StructureWrecked`, which plays the big explosion and shakes the camera. `GateView.Explode` shows a
  flash, a fireball, 120 sparks and twelve chunks of debris that fly, bounce and shrink; then the pylons keel over
  outward and the beam crashes down with a bounce. Gates always show their health bar.
- **Flora texture and colour:** `PropMeshBuilder` writes texture coordinates (tubes, blobs, boxes, blades) and
  tangents; `PropTextures` generates tileable albedo and normal maps for rock, bark and leaf (runtime normal maps
  store x in alpha for URP). `VisualTheme.PlantColor` sets the leaf colour per level, and `PropFactory` builds
  three hue-shifted material sets that `PropScatterBuilder` mixes by cell hash. Glow pools are smaller and only
  under crystals, trees, mushrooms and eggs.
- **Hero:** the sword is a separate hilt and blade. At rest it is clipped to the pack with the blade off, arms hang
  and swing with the stride; a strike draws it and ignites the blade, and it goes back after four quiet seconds.
- **Base:** `BaseReactor` is now an outpost on a square deck: two-storey command block with window strips and a
  lit door towards the road, reactor cylinder in a cage, lattice comms tower with a turning dish (its own pivot),
  landing pad ring, solar panels, crates. It stands 0.8 cells past the road end, door to the road, so the hero post
  is clear. `ModelPalette` metal is low-metallic because there is no reflection environment.
- **Lava:** a higher crater rim with brighter ash rock and hot cracks, plus rock and basalt teeth scattered on the
  rim (`PropScatterBuilder.PlaceLavaRim`).
- **Camera:** pan speed up from 9 to 17 units per second at full zoom.
- **Mesh builder:** a tube that still has width at its end now closes with a flat lid instead of a cone as tall as
  its radius (that cone was the "dome" on the old base and the dark cap on the dish). Only tapered tubes get a point.
- **Builds:** `Bootstrapper._shaderKeepers` references three saved materials (made by the generator in
  `Art/Materials/ShaderKeepers`) that carry the emission, normal-map and transparent keyword combinations the runtime
  materials use, so a player build keeps those shader variants.

## Look pass four (2026-10-29)

Feedback on pass three: base still plain, hero death "poof" and silent, sword wielding too simple and not reusable
for guns, towers ugly and not weapon-like, tower cards should be pictures, gate upgrade grows an ugly block.

- **Base:** `StructureModelFactory.BaseOutpost` returns `BaseParts`: a stepped deck with lit rim and a ramp to the
  road, a three-tier octagonal command tower with window bands and a spire, a spinning energy ring around it (the
  structure's `Ring` spinner), a caged reactor core, stacked habitat cylinders with portholes, a lattice mast with
  its own turning dish (`LevelVisualBuilder.AddSpinner`), a lit landing pad, shield pylons, solar panels, tanks and
  crates. Two point lights: one low, one on the tower.
- **Hero down:** `Commander` raises `Downed` and `Revived`. `HeroView` plays a stagger (sparks, visor stutter),
  a fall onto the side, an impact (sparks, dust, the weapon dropped beside it), then a smoking, powered-down lie
  (`HeroModelFactory.CreateMaterials(trim, powered: false)`) with the beacon red; the revive flashes a ring and
  rolls the figure back up. Sounds `HeroDown` and `HeroRevive` in `ProceduralSfx`, wired in `SfxPlayer`; the
  camera shakes on the fall.
- **Hero weapons as data:** `HeroWeaponDefinition` (kind melee/ranged, style, damage, reach, interval, targets,
  colour) is referenced by `HeroDefinition._weapon`; damage, reach and interval now come from the weapon. Assets:
  `Data/Hero/Weapon_EnergySword` (carried) and `Weapon_Blaster` (ready, not carried: point the Commander at it to
  try the ranged rig). `HeroWeaponModelFactory` builds the weapon meshes; `HeroWeaponRig` is the animation base
  (holster, draw, drop, rest pose), with `SwordRig` (draw twirl, swaying guard stance, three cycling cuts with
  trail) and `BlasterRig` (aim pose, kick, muzzle flash, bolt line). `HeroView` only asks the rig for a pose.
- **Towers:** `TowerModelFactory` rebuilt in one hard-edged language: a shared hexagonal `Pedestal()` with lit
  chevrons and a turret ring, a `Hull` per head, and `Parts` that carry the barrel pivot, recoil axis, muzzle
  point, rotary flag and scale. Gatlings (pulse rifle, storm rifle) spin while firing; the rocket pod and the
  artillery recoil along their tilt. The pulse rifle no longer uses the hand-made gun model (file kept on disk).
  `TowerShape.GateGun` is the small autocannon a gate grows on its beam with gun upgrades.
- **Cards:** `ModelIconRenderer` renders one model per frame into a sprite (cached per definition) and the HUD
  cards show that picture over a price strip; `TowerModelBuilder` and `PathObjectModels.Build` make the display
  copies, also used by `ModelPreview.ShowTower` on the reward and upgrade screens.
- **Play-test scripts** added: `hero_down.cs`, `hero_revive.cs`, `upgrade_gate.cs`; `zoom.cs` gained targets
  "towers" and "roster" and reads its size from `zoom_size.txt`.
- **Pitfall hit:** editing a script while Play Mode runs triggers a domain reload that drops all runtime state
  (hundreds of null references, "no context"). Stop Play Mode before touching scripts.

## Upgrade looks and projectile styles (2026-10-29, later)

- **Per-level looks:** `TowerModelFactory.CreateMaterials(colour, level)` runs hotter per level (brighter, whiter
  glow; body takes more tower colour; metal warms towards brass) and `Pedestal(level)` adds a lit rank ring per
  level. Every head gains parts per level: extra barrels, glow rings on the guns, missile side racks, a second
  pair of laser rails and a bigger lens, more frost rings, tesla halos, twin rail channels, artillery rings, a
  storm-rifle shroud, a thicker cryo prism, sensor masts.
- **Projectile styles:** `ProjectileStyle` (Bolt, Shell, Rocket, Laser, Frost, Lightning, Rail, Mortar) is data on
  `TowerDefinition._projectileStyle`; `Tower` fires from the barrel mouth with its style and colour. `Projectile`
  raises `Launched` and exposes `Origin`, `Destination` and `Progress`; `ProjectileView` dresses one pooled object
  per style (beam and glow line from the muzzle for lasers, jittering arc for lightning, missile with flame and
  smoke, frost shard shedding ice, long rail slug, lobbed mortar shell, tracer shell). `ImpactFlash` takes the
  weapon colour. `ShotInfo.Style` lets `SfxPlayer` pick laser, tesla and rail sounds (`ProceduralSfx`).
- **Play-test scripts** added: `upgrade_towers.cs`, `skip_wave.cs`, `shots_probe.cs`; `zoom.cs` also takes
  "spawn" and "enemy".

## Proportions (2026-10-29, evening)

Feedback: towers, guns and hero out of proportion, towers poking into the road and through the hero.

- Towers shrunk to sit inside their cell: `TowerModelFactory.TowerScale` 1.1 to 0.78, `PedestalScale` 0.76 (the
  pedestal mesh is modelled at cell size and scaled on placement), gate gun 0.55, level growth 7 percent, stars and
  health bar lowered to match. Card icons reframed.
- Hero figure scaled to 0.85 (`HeroView.FigureScale`): still taller than a tower, no longer a giant beside one.
- **Shoulder beside the road:** a tower built on a cell next to a road stands back from it inside its cell
  (`PlacementController.RoadClearance`, 0.3 cells away from the road neighbours), so a strip of ground stays open
  between the walking lane and the guns and a tower no longer sits on top of the hero. Gates stay on the road. The
  suit is warm pale with yellow shoulder pads and a little self-light, so it reads in dark levels and in the shadow
  of a hill. (A try at fading towers that cover the hero was dropped: not helpful in play.)
- **Maps match placement:** `TerrainField.ConfineToCells` keeps every terrain kind inside its own cells after the
  blur: hills, shores and craters no longer spill onto the flat cell beside them, so a tower on a build cell stands on
  level ground even when it is shifted away from the road. Slopes and beaches soften inside the raised or liquid
  cells. The shoulder grew to 0.4 cells and towers shrank a little more (scale 0.7, pedestal 0.66) so a shifted tower
  neither touches a cliff nor the tower in the row behind it.

## Wide roads and plazas (2026-10-29)

Roads are now two cells wide and the width is level data (`LevelDefinition._roadWidth`), not a constant. A level may
also list plaza cells (`_plazaCells`): open road where two or three roads meet.

- `Levels/RoadCorridor.cs` is the one source of truth for the road: all rows of every road path (the waypoints are
  the first row, extra rows lie to the **right of the direction of travel**, corners mitred so the outer corner is
  filled), the plaza cells, the direction through any road cell, the centre line (`CentreOf`, `Route`), the rung
  across the corridor (`Rung`, `RungContains`) and where a roller should head (`TryLocate`). `LevelDefinition.Road`
  caches it. `RoadDirection` and `RoadLocator` are gone; `BuildGrid`, `LevelValidator`, `TerrainField`,
  `TerrainPainter`, `PropScatterBuilder`, `EnemySpawner`, `HeroController`, `PlacementController`,
  `LevelVisualBuilder` and `DroneController` all read the corridor.
- Enemies walk the centre line (`PathOffset.Shift` by half the extra width) with lanes up to 0.7 cells either side
  (`EnemySpawner` lane constants grow per extra cell of width). Flying routes that end on the base cell end at the
  base itself.
- Gates span the corridor: `PlacementController` puts a blockade on the centre line, sets `Tower.Span` to the road
  width and occupies the whole rung plus the rung before it (the hero stand). `TowerView` builds the gate
  `Span + WallOverhang` wide. The hero spot marker is a strip across the road; any cell of the stand rung opens the
  hero menu (`HeroPostAt` uses `RungContains`).
- `RoadShape` draws ribbons along the centre lines with `HalfWidth = (width / 2 - 0.1) * cell` and treats plazas
  as road surface (depth behind the plaza outline counts as "inside"). `TerrainField` and `TerrainPainter` take
  the half width from the shape.
- Validator: every road cell (second rows too) must be on the grid, a blockade must sit on the first row of a road
  and not on a plaza, every plaza cell must connect to a road through plaza cells.
- Generator: `LevelSpec.RoadWidth` and `LevelSpec.Plazas` (`Rect(x0, y0, x1, y1)`); all five maps were redrawn.
  Design rule for serpentines: because the second row lies to the right of travel, legs that turn clockwise need
  five rows between their first rows and the others three, to keep two build rows between them. Forest, Ruins and
  Nest have a plaza where their two roads meet (Ruins gained a second road). All tower ranges went up by 0.5
  because the first build row moved half a cell out.
- `Tools/PlayTest/dump_map.cs` prints every level as text (road, plazas, gates, hero stands, base, terrain,
  blocked cells, mines) with its validation errors: the quickest way to check a layout.
- Checked in play: level 1 (serpentine, gate across the corridor, hero strip, base on the centre line, enemies in
  lanes) and level 2 (plaza at the junction). EditMode 81/81. PlayMode suite still not run; nothing committed.

### Hover marker and card badges (same day)

- The placement preview now stands exactly where the tower will stand: the ghost takes the same road clearance as
  a built tower, and the cursor marker on a build cell is a pedestal-sized plate at that spot
  (`PlacementController.PlaceMarker`). On a road cell the marker still covers the whole cell (a path object does).
- Tower cards carry small badges in the top left corner: ground (amber peaks), air (blue wings) and slow (pale
  snowflake), from `TowerDefinition.Targets` and `SlowFactor` (`HudView.Badges`, `IconFactory` Ground/Air/Slow).
  Support towers show no target badge.
- `Tools/PlayTest/hover_probe.cs` builds a tower beside the road and parks the placing cursor on the next cell.

### HUD layout, base menu and base explosion (same day)

- Towers beside water, a cliff, a rock or the map edge no longer hang over it: `PlacementController.RoadClearance`
  only uses the full 0.4-cell shift when every cell the pedestal could overhang is level ground like its own; otherwise
  it shifts 0.15 cells, which stays inside the cell (`PlainGroundAround`).
- `HudView` rebuilt: a 72 px strip at the top (base, energy number with a thin gauge, wave, speed/pause/skip icons)
  and a 156 px card bar at the bottom with money and the status line just above it. Cards are 136 x 140 in three
  bands: badges, picture, price. The speed icon carries its factor ("x1".."x3") and turns amber above x1.
- `DronePanelView` is gone. Drones are bought from the base: confirming on the last rung of the main road opens
  `BaseMenuView` (base and energy readout, one icon per drone kind with price and count), driven by
  `LevelContext.BaseMenuOpen`, which `PlacementController` sets and clears like the hero menu.
- `Levels/BaseView.cs` on the base root listens to `BaseHealth.Died`: flash, fireball, sparks, debris, lights out,
  the structure sinks and tilts, smoke for nine seconds. `SfxPlayer` plays `ProceduralSfx.BaseExplosion`,
  `CameraShaker` kicks at full strength, and `ResultView` waits 3.2 s before the defeat panel.
- `LevelVisualBuilder.BasePosition(level)` is the one place that knows where the base stands.
- Play-test scripts: `base_menu.cs` opens the base menu, `base_die.cs` destroys the base.

### Preview on pick, soft cursor, natural shores, menu pass (same day)

- Picking a card (or cycling with the shortcut) starts placing at once: `LevelContext.SelectTower` / `SelectPathObject`
  switch Browsing to Placing and raise `SelectionChanged`, which `PlacementController` answers with a refresh, so
  the preview stands at the cursor immediately. The cursor marker is translucent (alpha 0.28 browsing, 0.55 placing).
- Towers beside a liquid, cliff, rock or map edge stay almost centred (`FittedClearanceCells` 0.05), and liquids now
  keep a real shore inside their own cells: `TerrainField.FillLiquids` builds the mask from the distance to the cell
  outline (rounded outside corners, filleted inside corners, noise wobble, `ShoreWidthCells` 0.55) instead of a
  blurred-then-chopped mask. Liquid levels sit lower (`WaterLevel` -0.2) so a sloping bank shows above the sheet.
- Menu pass: the options overlay is opaque (the main-menu title showed through), the upgrade list stops higher above
  "Back to map" (`BackButtonClearance` 210), and the tower menu is 1000 wide so the upgrade preview line fits.
  Main menu, world map, difficulty picker, upgrade screen, tower/gate menu, hero panel, pause and result were all
  checked on screenshots.
- Play-test scripts: `click_button.cs` (clicks a UI button by label text from `button_arg.txt`, lists all labels),
  `open_menu.cs` (pause / tower / gate / hero / win from `menu_arg.txt`), `select_card.cs` (card index from
  `card_arg.txt`), `tower_at.cs` (builds on the cell in `cell_arg.txt`).
- Menu labels: the tower and base menus keep their price labels inside the backdrop (`LabelGap`); the enemy gate of a
  road stands on the corridor centre line (`Road.Route(index)[0]`), and the gates of flying routes float at flight
  height, smaller, so they no longer sit on top of a road gate next to them. `zoom_spawn.cs` zooms onto a path start.
- The range ring while placing is drawn around the same shifted stand position as the preview (`Refresh` computes
  one `stand` for the ghost and the ring).

## Drones: one drone per job (2026-10-29)

Remco chose fixed drones over one drone with modes: a repair drone, a harvest drone and an attack drone, each with
its own look. All are bought from the base menu with energy, which gathers slowly; faster energy is a permanent
upgrade for research points.

- Data: `DroneKind { Repair, Harvest, Attack }`; `DroneDefinition` holds the stats of every job (repair per second;
  harvest seconds and value; damage, interval, range, projectile speed, targets and style). `LevelDefinition` has
  `_repairDrone`, `_harvestDrone`, `_attackDrone` and `Drones` (the non-null ones, in menu order). Balance to start:
  repair 40 energy (8 HP/s), harvest 60 (4 s per load, 12 money a trip), attack 80 (6 damage every 0.5 s, range 3),
  three of each at most, energy 1.5/s up to 100.
- Logic: `Drones/Drone.cs` runs the three jobs; the attack drone hunts the enemy furthest along the road, closes to
  70% of its range, hovers and fires through `ProjectilePool` (so the shot sounds and effects come for free).
  The harvest drone raises `Delivered` at the base; `DroneWorld` carries everything a drone needs from the level.
- Look: `Core/DroneModelFactory.cs` builds the medic quadcopter (cross, lamp, tool arm), the twin-rotor hauler (cargo
  pod that lights up when loaded, drill) and the dart gunship (swept wings, gun pods, ducted tail fan).
  `Drones/DroneModelBuilder.cs` assembles hull, rotors on their own pivots and the cargo pod with the drone's colour
  on the hull; `DroneView` spins rotors, turns and banks into the heading, bobs, flashes the muzzles and shows a
  rising "+money" (`MoneyPopup`, a TextMesh) on delivery.
- Upgrades: `UpgradeTarget.HarvestDrones`, `AttackDrones` (free starters, power currency) next to `RepairDrones` and
  `DroneSpeed`; new `EnergyRate` (+25% per level, research points), applied in `LevelBootstrapper` when the energy
  pool is made (`PlayerModifiers.EnergyRateMultiplier`).
- UI: `BaseMenuView` shows one card per drone with a rendered picture of the model, its energy price, the count
  and "max" when the limit is reached; the info line shows the energy rate.
- Play-test scripts: `buy_drones.cs` (fills energy and launches one of each), `zoom_drone.cs` (zoom on a drone by
  kind from `zoom_arg.txt`, reports what it is doing).
- Checked in play: all three fly, the harvester delivers (+12 popup, money rises), the gunship goes for the enemies.
  EditMode 82/82 (new: energy-rate upgrade). PlayMode suite still not run; nothing committed.

## No loot from enemies, full view at start, quieter hero spots (2026-10-29)

- Enemies no longer drop loot and drones never pick money up from them: `PickupField`, `LevelContext.Pickups`,
  `DroneWorld.Pickups`, `EnemySpawner.DropLoot` and `StructureModelFactory.LootCrystal` are gone. The harvest drone
  only mines `MineCells` and delivers at the base.
- The camera starts fully zoomed out (`CameraPanZoom.StartZoom` 1, the whole field).
- Hero spot strips are a pale grey-blue, more translucent and barely glowing, so they mark the rung without shouting.

## Enemy overhaul: insect redesign, roller, pool spawns, boss powers, music (2026-10-29)

Remco's call after the drones: menacing monsters instead of toys, his own Roller idea, creatures out of the pools, flyers
that go for the gates, bosses with powers, and sound with music. Built in one go.

- **Creatures:** `EnemyModelFactory` rebuilt. A creature is a static shell plus a list of `CreaturePart`s with a
  `CreatureRole` (legs with hips and knees, mandibles and raptorial arms, antennae, wings, breathing abdomen, tail,
  roller bands, a floating orb). Dark glossy chitin, glow in the seams, eye clusters, plates and spines. Legs are
  stocky on purpose (the 55-degree camera turns a long thin leg pointing at it into a stick). New shapes: Roller,
  Drowner (water), Burrower (quicksand), Cinder (lava, sheds embers). `EnemyView` animates per role: stepping legs with
  folding knees, dangling legs under flyers, snapping jaws, twitching feelers, beating wing pairs, breathing, sway;
  the roller curls its bands into a ring that spins with the distance rolled. Spawning depends on `Enemy.Origin`:
  gate, pool (splash in the pool's colour, deeper and slower) or ground (dust, deepest). On death the legs fold in
  (`EnemyDeathEffect` collapse phase, `Part.Curled`) before the pieces fly apart.
- **Roller:** `EnemyDefinition.WalkSeconds/RollSeconds/RollSpeedMultiplier`; `Enemy.Step` alternates, rolling is faster,
  no armour; a gate makes it unroll and bite. Data: walk 3 s, roll 2.2 s at x2.6, from the Forest on.
- **Pools as spawn points:** `SpawnGroup.Source` (Gate/Water/Lava/Quicksand); `LiquidPools` groups liquid cells into
  pools (those wholly off the grid are ignored), `OffRoadRoute` builds start -> nearest road cell -> rest of that road,
  with the progress offset so towers rank the newcomer fairly. The validator refuses a pool source without such a pool.
- **Flyers strike gates:** `EnemyDefinition.GateStrikes` (3); the spawner inserts the nearest gate as a waypoint, the
  flyer hovers over a living gate, hits it that many times, and flies on.
- **Boss powers:** `BossAbilityDefinition` (Pulse / Laser / Spawn) listed on the enemy; `BossAbilities` runs the timers
  (`StructureRegistry.DamageInRadius` / `DamageAlongBeam`), `BossAbilityView` draws the beam with a burning tip, the
  expanding ring and spores. Overseer: mind laser; Warden: shockwave; Queen: brood of scouts plus a shockwave.
  Mid-wave bosses: Lava gets the Overseer in wave 4, the Nest the Warden. Per level a `BossEntrance` (Gate / Pool /
  Ground with a cell): Forest and Lava from a pool, Ruins through the ground, Nest through the hive mouth.
  `LevelContext.BossWave/BossWaveStarted/BossesAlive/BossPulsed/BossLaserChanged/BossMinionsReleased`; the HUD shows
  "BOSS" in red; the camera shakes on the wave start, the entrance and every pulse.
- **Sound:** `Synth` moved to its own file (shared by effects and music). `AudioMix` (master, music, effects, ambience)
  registered at boot from four saved percentages (`ProgressData`, `ProgressService.SetVolumes`); `VolumeControls`
  shared by the options overlay and the new "Sound" page of the pause menu. `ProceduralMusic` writes a calm light-rock
  loop (100 bpm) and a heavy one (132 bpm); `MusicPlayer` crossfades to the heavy loop while a boss is out (and from
  the alarm on), plays the siren and quake rumble on a boss wave and ducks the ambience. `SfxPlayer` rebuilt: voice
  budgets per kind (shots 3, kills 2, hits 2, spawns 2), bundling of shots within 60 ms, ducking under priority sounds,
  zoom attenuation with a low-pass per voice (each voice on its own object), laser hum loops, new clips for boss
  pulse/laser, minion bursts, emergence from water/lava/sand/ground and the roller's curl.
- **Generator:** `Bestiary`, `ExtraStream`s per level (rollers, pool creatures) appended from a given wave on,
  `MidBoss`, `BossEntrance` snapped to a surviving liquid cell, boss ability assets under `Data/Enemies/Abilities`.
- **Tests:** EditMode 94/94 (new: `EnemyBehaviourTests`, `PoolSpawnTests`, `AudioTests`). Play-test scripts:
  `spawn_enemy.cs`, `zoom_enemy.cs` (freezes time; `resume.cs` thaws), `no_waves.cs`, `inspect_enemy.cs`,
  `shadows_off.cs`, `goto_menu.cs`, `sfx_probe.cs`.
- Checked in play: every creature up close, roller rolling, drowner out of a pond, burrower out of quicksand, cinder
  out of lava, overseer surfacing from a pond and from lava, warden breaking out of the ground and its pulse ring,
  flyer hovering at a gate, pause-menu sound page and main-menu options. The laser was seen only as a thin line
  before it was made thicker; the beam logic is covered by tests. Music and alarm not heard (no speakers here).
- Not done: PlayMode suite not run; nothing committed; balance of the new streams and boss powers to be felt in play.

## Main menu as a living diorama with its own music (2026-10-29)

Remco asked for a fancy main menu while he was away: glowing, moving parts, plants, enemies in their nest, lava, sand
and water, and light rock music.

- **Scene:** `MenuStage` (Boot) is the composition root of the MainMenu scene: it makes the camera with the game's
  post-processing and hands it to `MenuDiorama` (UI), which builds a floating island from a `MenuStageDefinition`
  (`Data/Menu/MainMenuStage.asset`, written by the generator: the Forest, Lava, Ruins and Nest themes plus the
  creatures to show). `MenuTerrain` is one height function (basins for the pools, a mound for the hive with a flat
  porch at its mouth, a ragged cliff all round) that also paints the albedo and emission textures, so each corner has
  the ground colour and glow of its theme (lava cracks, pond speckles, hive veins). Pools reuse
  `TerrainLiquidBuilder.BuildPool` (extracted from the level loop, with `SurfaceLevel`), plants and rocks come from
  `PropFactory` with `WindSway`, glow decals and a shared `EmissionPulse`, lights flicker, spores drift, stars lie
  far below. The hive mouth is a black oval on the slope with a pulsing chitin rim and a red light inside.
- **Creatures:** `MenuCreature` wraps the real `Enemy` + `EnemyView` (health bar hidden via `EnemyView.HideHealthBar`)
  on a route of its own, sinks away at the route's end and comes up again after a rest. The Queen sits on the porch;
  grunts, a scout and a roller crawl out of the mouth, lap the mound and go back in; two flyers circle; the Drowner,
  Cinder and Burrower surface in their pool, stroll the bank and dive back.
- **Camera:** `MenuCameraDrift` circles a few degrees around its focus and bobs, never still.
- **UI:** `MainMenuScreen` keeps the buttons on a translucent panel along the left with a subtitle under the title;
  `ScreenBase.Starfield` lets a screen drop the flat starfield. The options dim is slightly see-through.
- **Music:** `ProceduralMusic.Menu()` (92 bpm, E-G-D-A, plucked arpeggio, a melody over the whole loop; new `Pluck`
  instrument). `MenuMusic` (UI) is created by the first menu screen, survives menu-to-menu loads, follows the mix,
  and fades out and destroys itself when the Level or Boot scene loads. The diorama plays the hive ambience quietly.
- **Tests:** EditMode 96/96 (new `MenuStageTests`: generated asset complete, terrain sinks pools under their surface
  and flattens the porch; menu loop length in `AudioTests`). The test assembly now references `Game.UI`.
- **Checked in play:** menu with the island, Queen, crawlers, roller, flyer, pool creatures; options over the scene;
  Start to the map with the music still playing; a level start removes the menu music and the level score runs;
  back to the menu rebuilds the diorama. Zero errors and warnings.
- Play-test scripts: `menu_probe.cs` (stage, cameras, diorama), `menu_creatures.cs` (every creature's state),
  `music_probe.cs` (menu music vs level music).
- Not done: nothing committed; music not heard here; the balance of colours is a first pass to be judged by eye.

## Story, region map, boss cues and sliders (2026-10-29, evening)
- **Menu music** reworked after feedback ("too happy"): E minor throughout (i, VI, VII, i, turnaround to V), palm-muted
  eighths (`Track.Chug`), harder kick and snare, crash on each half, a low pentatonic riff instead of the long melody,
  104 bpm, more drive. `Pluck` was removed with the arpeggio.
- **Volume options are sliders** (`UiKit.CreateSlider`, `VolumeControls`): left/right on the gamepad moves in tenths,
  the mouse drags freely, the saved value snaps to 5 %. Used by the options panel and the pause menu.
- **Bosses**: bigger and slower (Overseer 1.75/0.7, Warden 2.2/0.6, Queen 2.7/0.55 scale/speed) with more health
  (650/2000/3200); eyes and seams glow 1.9x and breathe (`EmissionPulse`), a point light in the boss colour under it.
  The final boss wave gets flyer escorts per difficulty (`BossEscortFlyers` 0/1/2/4) on top of the health multiplier.
- **Boss cues**: from the alarm until the boss shows, `SfxPlayer` repeats an approach sound that fits the level's
  entrance (growl for gate/ground, bubbles for water, lava churn, sand shift). `BossMarkerView` on the HUD points an
  arrow and "BOSS" at the entrance, then at the boss: pinned to the screen edge while it is out of view.
- **Story in data**: `StoryDefinition` (`Data/Story/Story.asset`, referenced by the campaign catalog) holds the intro
  beats (text, scene, seconds). Every `LevelDefinition` has `_regionName` and `_briefing`.
- **Intro scene** (`IntroScreen`, scene `Intro`): plays once on first launch (`ProgressData.IntroSeen`), stars, the
  planet closing in with a tiny ship, regions blinking, the dive onto the first region and a fade to the main menu.
  Any button skips. Boot decides between Intro and MainMenu.
- **Planet map** rebuilt: a globe taller than the screen, painted by `PlanetPainter` (sea/land noise, one tinted
  region per level from its theme colours, atmosphere rim, halo, slowly turning clouds). Each level is a beacon with a
  pulsing ring (dimmed when locked, a check when beaten) and a dotted route. Choosing a beacon zooms the globe onto
  the region and opens the region panel (region, level, briefing, four difficulties with checks and stars, Back).
  B closes the panel, or leaves to the main menu from the overview.
- **Briefing before the first wave** (`BriefingView`): only when the session asks for it (`LevelSession(.., true)`
  from the map), time is held (`TimeController.Hold`) until Deploy. Tests and play scripts start levels without it.
- Verified in Play Mode: boss alarm with the arrow on the pond entrance, Overseer surfacing with the arrow over it,
  the edge arrow when zoomed elsewhere, approach sound scheduling, the options sliders, the intro (skipped via its
  Finish), the map overview, zoom and region panel, level start with the briefing holding time and Deploy releasing
  it. EditMode 99/99, zero errors and warnings. Nothing committed.
- Play-test scripts: `boss_alarm.cs`, `boss_probe.cs`, `sfx_voices.cs`, `sliders.cs`, `map_pick.cs`,
  `time_probe.cs`, `intro_probe.cs`, `intro_skip.cs`, `screen_probe.cs`.
- Not done: music and sounds not heard here; boss balance is a first pass to be judged by play.

## Waves per level, boss spacing, shot sound cooldown, placement fix (2026-10-29, late)
- **Placement**: towers beside a road shifted 0.4 cells away from it, and a 0.7-cell pedestal then stood inside a tower on
  the next cell. `RoadClearanceCells` is 0.15 now; occupancy per cell was already right.
- **Shot sounds**: much quieter (0.12 rapid, 0.2 heavy, 0.15 laser). Rapid-fire towers (pulse, storm, tesla, cryo) start
  their sound at most every 0.22 s; shots in between only nudge the playing voice, so a row of rifles reads as one burst
  (`RapidCooldownSeconds`). Slow towers keep a sound per shot under the three-voice budget.
- **Two bosses on hard**: `WaveScheduler` rounded `Count * CountMultiplier` up, so one boss became two a second apart.
  A boss group now ignores the count multiplier, and several bosses in one group are at least 18 s apart.
- **Waves rebuilt** (`ProjectGenerator.Waves.cs`): every level has a `WaveScript` (its own wave count: Landing 20, Forest 25, Lava 30,
  Ruins 35, Nest 40; troops with first wave, weight, interval and spawn source; a rhythm string of P plain, R rush,
  H heavy, M ambush that repeats when shorter; air-raid waves with a count per difficulty; air sprinkle from a
  difficulty; its own boss waves, the last boss with escorts). A threat budget (health/20) runs geometrically from
  `Budget` to `FinalBudget`; weights lean towards tougher creatures as the level goes on (`HeavyBias`); a new troop always sends
  at least one; groups cap at 36 before the difficulty multiplier. Pool creatures only come in ambush waves, mid-wave.
  Landing zone has no flyers at all on easy (medium 1, hard 2, psycho 3 air waves). All ordinary enemies walk ~35 %
  slower. The old shared templates, `ExtraStream` and `BuildWaveSets` are gone.
- `Tools/PlayTest/dump_waves.cs` writes every wave of every level and difficulty to `Tools/PlayTest/waves_dump.txt`
  (counts per creature, `*` = second lane or air route, `~` = from a pool, threat and span).
- Lesson: never recompile while the player is in Play Mode; check `editor_status` first. A recompile mid-play flooded
  the console and left the editor unresponsive until a restart.
- Open: drones to be paid with money (energy to go); waiting on what to do with the "start with one more drone" upgrades.

## Drones bought with money, energy removed, boss laser fix (2026-10-29, night)
- **Energy is gone**: `EnergyPool`, the HUD energy readout and bar, the level's energy fields, the energy-rate upgrade
  and the "start each level with one more drone" upgrades (assets deleted, catalog regenerated). `PlayerModifiers`
  and `UpgradeEffects` keep only `DroneSpeedMultiplier` for drones; `UpgradeTarget` lost four values (regenerate data
  after pulling, the enum indices moved).
- **Drones cost money** (`DroneDefinition.Cost`: repair 120, harvest 150, attack 180), bought in the base menu with
  the wallet; nobody starts a level with a drone. `Drone_Speed` (power currency) is the only drone upgrade.
- **Boss laser stuck after death**: a pooled boss is switched off when it dies, so neither `BossAbilities.Update` nor
  the view's `LateUpdate` ran again and the beam (a sibling object) stayed on with the hum. Both now switch the
  laser off in `OnDisable`.
- Generator: `CreateDrone` marks the asset dirty, because writing a value equal to the field default left the
  stale `_energyCost` line on disk.
- Scripts: `laser_probe.cs` (boss laser state, "kill" in `enemy_arg.txt` kills the bosses), `drone_probe.cs`
  (money and drones), `buy_drones.cs` now fills the purse.
- **Boss laser locks on**: the laser no longer sweeps the ground. `BossAbilities` asks the spawner for the nearest
  tower, gate or hero in range (`EnemySpawner.FindLaserTarget`, hero wrapped as `HeroTarget : IStructure`), follows
  it for the beam's duration and burns it; without a target it retries after 2 s. `SweepDegrees` and
  `StructureRegistry.DamageAlongBeam` are gone. The view draws the beam from the model part named "Orb" (the
  Overseer's mind-orb, which swells while firing) with an opaque glowing core and a see-through halo.
- **Overseer head** redrawn: bigger pale head with large eyes, mandibles, a glowing collar, three crown spikes and a
  stalk up to a larger ringed orb, so front and weapon read from above.
- Scripts: `laser_now.cs` fires every boss laser at once.

## Balance pass, mines that run dry, screen pulse, sound research (2026-10-30)
- **Mining nodes deplete**: `LevelDefinition.MineStock` (140 money per node, three nodes a level) is drained trip by
  trip through `DroneWorld.MineStocks`; a harvest drone skips empty nodes and waits at home when all are spent;
  `LevelContext.MineDepleted` turns the node's `MiningNodeView` dull. Harvest yield 12 -> 10 per trip, at most two
  harvest drones. So the harvest drones earn a bounded sum (about 420 a level) instead of a stream.
- **Kill rewards cut** (scout 3, grunt 5, brute 14, flyer 6, roller 7, drowner 6, burrower 6, cinder 8) and the
  **difficulty profiles raised**: Medium health 1.1 / count 1.05, Hard 1.6 / 1.4, Psycho 2.4 / 1.9.
- `BalanceProbeTests` reads an optional `Tools/PlayTest/probe_arg.txt` (`levels=0,1`, `difficulties=1,2`) and
  reports money; run it async: `run_tests --mode PlayMode --filter GreedyBot_PlaysEveryLevel_WithoutErrors
  --filter_type testName --async_tests true`, result in `Temp/pipeline_test_status.json`, report in the console.
  After this pass the greedy bot (no upgrades, no drones) won Landing on Medium (30/30) and Hard (12/30), won Forest
  on Medium and lost Forest on Hard at wave 12. A human who upgrades will do better; judge by play.
- **Screen pulse** (`ScreenPulse`, built by `PostProcessingBuilder` on the high profile): a lens punch and a flash of
  chromatic fringing on explosions (by radius), boss pulses, the boss alarm, the hero's shockwave, a wrecked tower
  and the base's death; decays in 0.4 s on unscaled time. The low profile leaves it idle.
- **Laser beams** of the towers now have an opaque glowing core (bloom picks it up) under the see-through halo,
  like the boss beam.
- **Sounds**: Kenney's "Sci-fi Sounds" (70 files) and "Impact Sounds" (130 files) are CC0 and fit shooting and
  impacts; the site serves the zip only through a browser click (curl gets a 199-byte stub), so the player has to
  download them. Plan once they are in `Assets/_Project/Audio/Kenney/`: an `SfxLibrary` ScriptableObject that maps
  each procedural sound to an optional clip, used by `SfxPlayer` when assigned, procedural otherwise.
- Scripts: `pulse_probe.cs` (kick the pulse), `lens_hold.cs` (hold the lens bent for a screenshot).
- **Recorded sounds in place** (2026-10-30): Remco downloaded Kenney "Sci-fi Sounds" (CC0, 70 ogg) and Lentikula
  "Sci-Fi Weapon Shots" (CC0, 15 wav); extracted to `Assets/_Project/Audio/Kenney_SciFi/` and `.../Lentikula/`
  (the 7z opened with Windows' own `C:\Windows\System32\tar.exe`, Git Bash tar cannot). `SfxLibrary`
  (`Data/Audio/SfxLibrary.asset`, filled by the generator from `SfxClips`, registered by the Bootstrapper) holds a
  few variants per sound; `SfxPlayer.Family` hands them out in turn and falls back to the generated clip when a
  list is empty. Mapped: pulse = Lentikula laser rifle, rail = laser beam, hero blaster = laser pistol; cannon =
  laserLarge, rocket = thrusterFire, cryo = laserRetro, tesla = forceField, explosions = explosionCrunch, big
  explosions = lowFrequency_explosion, structure hits = impactMetal, enemy deaths = slime, base hits =
  explosionCrunch. Credits in `Docs/CREDITS.md`. Not swapped yet: build/upgrade/sell, horns, alarms, boss roars,
  emergence sounds and the hero's blade (still generated). Volumes untouched; judge by ear.
- Boss laser hum: Remco's `freesound_community-laser-weld-103309.mp3` (Pixabay Content License) in
  `Assets/_Project/Audio/Freesound/` loops as the boss laser through `SfxLibrary.BossLaserLoops` (first clip).

## Feedback round: bolts, muzzle alignment, impact ripples, boss flash, health bars (2026-10-30)
- **Screen pulse removed** (`ScreenPulse` deleted, `PostProcessingBuilder.Build` is void again): Remco disliked the
  whole-screen punch. In its place **impact ripples**: `RippleEffects` (Levels) keeps twelve flat quads with the
  hand-written `Game/ImpactRipple` shader (`Assets/_Project/Art/Shaders/`), which refracts the URP opaque texture
  along a ring that runs outward in 0.35 s; played on explosions (by radius), the hero's strikes, boss pulses and
  wrecked towers. High profile only (`PC_RPAsset` has the opaque texture on); the generator writes a keeper material
  (`ShaderKeepers/ImpactRipple.mat`) so the shader survives a build. Camera shake is unchanged.
- **Bolts** are glowing rounded bars (the capsule slug, turned onto the heading) with a thin light trail instead of
  light balls; the rail keeps the longer, brighter slug.
- **Muzzle alignment**: `Tower.MuzzleProvider` lets `TowerView` hand the logic the position of its barrel mouth
  (the muzzle flash object), so beams and bolts leave the gun that fires them; towers without a view fall back to
  the old estimate.
- **Boss hit flash off**: a boss keeps its own glow when shot (the white strobe annoyed).
- **Health bars**: a thin line (0.035 high, 0.6 wide) that only appears once a creature is damaged.
- Script: `ripple_probe.cs` plays a ripple at the hero and holds the frame. `pulse_probe.cs` and `lens_hold.cs` are gone.
- Boss alarm: Remco's `warning.mp3` (source still to be noted in `Docs/CREDITS.md`) plays as the siren through
  `SfxLibrary.BossAlarms` (first clip), used by `MusicPlayer`; the generated siren stays as fallback.

## Bestiary v2: nine species with skills, skins, nests, species bosses (2026-10-30)
Remco found the enemies "all the same"; the roster was rebuilt around one skill per species, as in nature. Old
species (Scout, Grunt, Brute, Flyer, Drowner, Burrower, Cinder, Overseer, Warden) are gone; Roller and Hive Queen stay.
- **Species** (`ProjectGenerator.Bestiary.cs`, data in `Data/Enemies/`): Skitter (ant swarm, bleeds venom), Stinger
  (scorpion, armour plates, acid sting on towers in passing), Ember/Tide/Moss/Dustbat (element flyers, bolts, rise
  from nests, crash and dissolve), Bulwark (shield bearer, armour, crystal sword, collapses), Prowler (pack, rage
  haste when a mate dies), Wisp (walks the road, hit by ground and air guns, bursts), Skyray (flying whip), Oozer
  (slime trail). Each species has a boss: BroodMother, AcidEmpress, StormMatriarch, CrystalWarlord, PackAlpha,
  CoreWisp, SkySovereign, SlimeMonarch, RollerKing.
- **Mechanics**: `Health` armour layer (soaks a share until chipped, `RestoreArmor`); `EnemyDefinition.Flies` apart
  from the `Layer` mask (Wisp = Ground|Air, walks); `Enemy.ApplyHaste`; `TrailDropped` -> `SlimeField` (Levels,
  hurries other species, burns hero and gates, never towers) drawn by `SlimeFieldView`; pack rage in `EnemySpawner`;
  `DifficultyProfile.StructureDamageMultiplier` (0.7/1/1.35/1.8) scales attacks on structures and boss powers;
  element nests (`ElementNest`, `LevelDefinition.Nests`, `SpawnSource.Nest`, validator checks, nest props in
  `LevelVisualBuilder`, generator reserves their cells). New boss kinds: Volley, Rally, Regrow, Split.
- **Bug fixed**: `LevelController` dropped the spawn source, so pool spawns never happened in real play.
- **Look**: `EnemyModelFactory` rebuilt (five slots: body, eyes, glow, dark, accent; `AccentColor` and `BloodColor`
  on the definition). `CreatureSkin` (Core) paints tiling chitin/hide/slime/scales/energy/membrane textures with
  normal maps and glowing seams, tinted per species. New roles: Plate (sheds as armour drops), Fin, Blade, Stinger.
  `EnemyDeathEffect` styles: Shatter, Crash, Collapse, Burst. `EnemyBoltView` draws enemy shots. Runners keep
  bent knees and splayed feet, bodies shift weight when idle, tails flick (Remco: nothing should stand like a statue).
- **Waves**: per-level scripts with the new species, `Troop.MinDifficulty` (tide bats skip easy on Landing), threat
  prices armour and damage. Bosses per level: Landing BroodMother/PackAlpha; Forest RollerKing/StormMatriarch; Lava
  CoreWisp/AcidEmpress/CrystalWarlord; Ruins SlimeMonarch/SkySovereign/CrystalWarlord; Nest PackAlpha/AcidEmpress/
  CoreWisp/HiveQueen.
- **Tests**: 107 EditMode tests pass (armour, haste, trail, slime, boss powers, nests, every shape builds); the
  five PlayMode tests pass too, including the greedy-bot balance probe over every level and difficulty
  (`run_tests --mode PlayMode --async_tests true`, then poll `test_status`; the first reply says 0 tests, the
  run is still going).
- **Play-test scripts**: `spawn_many.cs` (list in `spawn_list.txt`, "Name [Source]"), `kill_all.cs`, `step100.cs`
  (100 frames at 3x), `waves_on.cs`.
- **Open**: balance probe on the new roster, the sting tail reads weakly from the 55-degree camera, bats could use a
  second look at close range, more posture work on the Stinger and Oozer idle.
- **Nests stay away from the base** (2026-10-30, later): Remco saw creatures come up almost beside the base. The
  validator now rejects a nest whose creatures join the road past 60% of its length (`LevelValidator.MaxNestRoadShare`),
  the nests were moved (Landing both in the lake, Forest wood nest on the plateau, Ruins only the first-half drifts
  with a new sand patch at 16-18/13-14 and no tide bats, Nest level water nests in the north pond), and the share of
  an ambush wave that surfaces from pools and nests now scales with difficulty (30/45/55/65%). `nest_report.cs`
  prints the share per nest. Maps are not enlarged yet; that is an open option if the roads still feel short.
